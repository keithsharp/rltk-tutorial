# Roguelike Tutorial in Rust
This repository is my attempt at working through the [Roguelike Tutorial in Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com).  I was heavily inspired by [Uncle Scientist's](https://www.youtube.com/c/UncleScientist) "Writing a Roguelike using RLTK" [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLib6-zlkjfXlSssBzA-ufj2qJdEFpJYUc) on YouTube, where he works through the tutorial in bitesized chunks.
